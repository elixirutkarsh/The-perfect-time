# The-perfect-time
You have two clocks. Clock A runs perfectly and shows the correct time. Clock B, on the other hand, runs slower and loses 1 minute every hour. Both clocks were set to the correct time at noon. Now it's 2:00 PM.

What is the time displayed on Clock B?

Solution:
Clock B loses 1 minute every hour. It's been 2 hours since noon (from noon to 2:00 PM), so Clock B has lost 2 minutes.

The correct time at 2:00 PM is 2:00 PM. However, Clock B has lost 2 minutes, so it shows 1:58 PM.
